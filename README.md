This folder contains code, data, and plots for krigingand clustering for different axies as like XY, XZ, and YZ.

* **data**: This folder has raw/original data, processed data, and combined data:
  * processed data: `9_full_sensor_spike_data_processed.csv`
  * original/raw data:`9_full_sensor_spike_original.xlsx`


* **plots**: This folder saves all plots after running the code.

* **plot_2D_9spike_data_all_in_one.py**: This code is used for 2D plotting for all parameter in one plot.

* **krig_clustering_levee_wlc_conductivity_XY.py**: This is 2D kriging and clustering code for XY plane.
* **krig_clustering_levee_wlc_conductivity_XZ.py**: This is 2D kriging and clustering code for XZ plane.
* **krig_clustering_levee_wlc_conductivity_YZ.py**: This is 2D kriging and clustering code for YZ plane.
